      /*
      A word is an anagram of another word if both use the same letters in the same quantity, but arranged differently.
      
      Write a function that checks if two provided strings are anagrams of each other; letter casing shouldn’t matter. 
      Also, consider only characters, not spaces or punctuation

      For example:
      anagram('finder', 'Friend')  --> true
      anagram('hello', 'bye') --> false
      */

      /*
      A suitable data structure to hold the anagram data would be a JavaScript object literal. The key is the letter character and the value is the number of times that letter is contained in the given string.

      
      Edge Cases
      - make sure letter casing isn’t factored into the comparison; just transform both strings into either lower case or upper case
      - leave everything that isn’t a character out of the comparison; a good option would be to use a regular expression.
